# Launch Sequence (MVP)

A lightweight, developer-focused **feature flag management platform**, initially scoped to the **core feature flag lifecycle**: creation, evaluation, targeting, and real-time updates. The goal is to deliver a **cost-efficient, edge-native MVP** that is fast, simple, and production-viable without enterprise bloat.

---

## 🎯 Product Goals

* Provide a **minimal but robust alternative** to LaunchDarkly for small teams and startups
* Optimize for **low latency**, **low cost**, and **operational simplicity**
* Support **real-time flag updates** without SDK polling
* Establish a clean foundation for future expansion (experiments, analytics, environments, RBAC)

---

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP)

### Feature Flag Management

* Create, update, and delete feature flags
* Flag types:

    * Boolean (on/off)
    * String / JSON (future-ready)
* Default values per flag

### Targeting & Rules (Phase 1)

* Global enable / disable
* User-based targeting using:

    * User ID
    * Attributes (key/value)
* Rule precedence with deterministic evaluation

### SDK / Client Evaluation

* Server-side flag evaluation via API
* Client-side flag hydration via edge
* Deterministic evaluation (no experimentation yet)

### Real-Time Updates

* Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live flag updates
* Clients receive updates immediately without polling

### Authentication

* Email + password authentication
* Session-based auth
* Scoped per organization / project

### Projects & Environments (Lightweight)

* Organization
* Project
* Environment (e.g. prod, staging)

---

## 🖥️ UI / Pages

### Authentication

* Login
* Signup

### Dashboard

* List of projects
* Flag counts and status

### Feature Flags

* Flag list view
* Create / edit flag
* Toggle on/off
* Targeting rules editor (simple UI)

### SDK & Integration

* SDK keys per environment
* Usage instructions

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview (MVP)

### High-Level Principles

* **Edge-first** architecture
* **Single-region, minimal infra**
* Avoid heavy managed services early
* Optimize for rapid iteration

---

### Frontend / Edge Layer

**Cloudflare Workers**

* Runs **Remix + React**
* Server-side rendering (SSR) at the edge
* Handles:

    * UI rendering
    * Auth session validation
    * Calls to internal APIs

---

### Data Layer

**Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)**

* Primary relational store
* Tables for:

    * Users
    * Organizations
    * Projects
    * Environments
    * Feature flags
    * Targeting rules

Chosen for:

* Near-zero operational overhead
* Tight integration with Workers
* Sufficient scale for MVP

---

### Realtime Layer

**Cloudflare Durable Objects**

* Acts as a **stateful realtime coordinator**
* Responsibilities:

    * Manage SSE connections
    * Broadcast flag updates
    * Ensure per-project isolation

---

### API Layer

**Cloudflare Workers (API routes)**

* REST-style endpoints
* Responsibilities:

    * Flag CRUD
    * Flag evaluation
    * Auth
    * SDK key validation

No separate backend service in MVP.

---

### Auth Strategy

* Native email/password auth
* Passwords hashed and stored in D1
* Signed session cookies
* No third-party auth dependency for MVP

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Environment-scoped SDK keys
* Read-only SDK access
* Admin-only mutation endpoints
* Strict project isolation

---

## 📦 SDK Strategy (Initial)

* Thin SDKs (JS / Node first)
* Responsibilities:

    * Identify user
    * Subscribe to SSE
    * Cache flags locally

No heavy client logic — server remains source of truth.

---

## 🚧 Explicit Non-Goals (for MVP)

* A/B testing or experimentation
* Metrics, analytics, or flag insights
* Advanced RBAC
* Multi-region replication
* Complex rule DSL

---

## 🛣️ Future Expansion (Post-MVP)

* Percentage rollouts
* Experiments
* Audit logs
* Role-based access control
* Webhooks
* Multi-region data replication
* Enterprise auth (SSO)

---

## 🧠 Summary

This MVP focuses on **doing one thing extremely well**: fast, reliable feature flag delivery with real-time updates — at a fraction of the cost and complexity of enterprise flag platforms. The architecture is intentionally minimal, edge-native, and designed to evolve incrementally as real usage demands it.
